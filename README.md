⚠️ **[UPDATE]** Blog has a new home. I just moved [blog.marcreyes.ph](blog.marcreyes.ph) domain to Medium in hopes of reaching more audiences. This site will still be available on the webspace at [blog-legacy.marcreyes.ph](blog-legacy.marcreyes.ph). Hope you'll still continue to read the stories that I'll be sharing soon.
